What I got AA?

I found this subject is interesting because I can get knowledge about socket programming and how networks works.
So, for getting AA I will do following
1. I attended the lectures seriously.
2. I took down notes in lecture.
	All important concepts wrote in notebook. If not able to to understood then asked to instructor and read on net.
3. I completed all assignments in time and also submit it.
	All assignments work did by me. Took help from classmates and internet but copied after undersatnding meaning of it. Also 	  cited the references helped for assignmnet completion. 
4. I read all the material provided.
